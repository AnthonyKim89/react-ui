# Dev Notes 2017-01-19

## Subscriptions

* Refactored subscriptions to its own reducer/actions/selectors for better architectural cohesion.
* Added support for app settings to be included in subscription params. This is used for the time period in traces.

## Traces

* Functional version of the Single Trace app.

## Layout

* Move app action buttons to the bottom edge of apps and made them hidden until the user hovers the mouse over the app. An exception to this is made on touch devices, where the buttons are always visible.
  * To support this, added a Modernizr build for touch detection to `public`. It is loaded to the page with a script tag, and it adds a CSS class to the document body, which we target in our CSS.

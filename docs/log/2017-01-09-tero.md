## Asset Navigation

* Added `AssetListPage` component for asset listing. Also configured routes and navigation for it.
* The page displays assets in a table, and includes filtering and sorting capabilities.
  * Filter and sort parameters are put into the page location so that it is possible to bookmark / send a direct link to a filtered list.

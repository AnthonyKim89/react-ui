# Dev Notes 2016-12-01

## General

* Added error handling support to the API: When the API returns a non-OK HTTP status code, an Exception is thrown with the response `status` and `statusText`. (Or rather, the API Promise is rejected but with async/await this translates to basically an exception being thrown.)
* Code organization change: Put all components in a `components` subfolder of their respective model to clearly separate them from other code. (This is in line with http://jaysoo.ca/2016/02/28/organizing-redux-application/)

## Login

Implemented an authentication system so that the app is not reliant on the user being already signed in through Rails.

* We react to API responses with status 401 by displaying a Login page.
* The login pages allows the user to enter an email and a password.
* Upon signin, we send a POST request to `/sessions`.
* Upon a successful login, we take the user back to the main dashboard.

# Dev Notes 2016-12-01

## General

* Added error handling support to the API: When the API returns a non-OK HTTP status code, an Exception is thrown with the response `status` and `statusText`. (Or rather, the API Promise is rejected but with async/await this translates to basically an exception being thrown.)
* Code organization change: Put all components in a `components` subfolder of their respective model to clearly separate them from other code. (This is in line with http://jaysoo.ca/2016/02/28/organizing-redux-application/)

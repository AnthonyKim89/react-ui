## Widget Addition

* Added a button to the widget grid for adding new widget. It launches a modal dialog implemented with [react-modal](https://github.com/reactjs/react-modal).
* The modal shows the supported widget types in a list of expandable categories.
* When a widget type is selected, it is added to the widget grid of the current page:
  * First a position is assigned to it (currently we just take the first available forw on the grid)
  * Then it is POSTed to the API.
  * When API response is received the widget is added to the grid of the current page.

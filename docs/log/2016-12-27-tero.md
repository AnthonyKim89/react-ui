## Chart Performance

After subscriptions & live updates were added, we observed some performance issues with the Highcharts-rendered broomsticks.

By doing some profiling, I pinpointed the problem to the Highcharts re-rendering code, which could take up to 400-500ms even on a high-end laptop on Chrome.

The real issue here is the way react-highcharts re-renders charts, which is by *fully recreating the Highcharts object* every time the props change. This is simple and fits the React philosophy well, but in practice causes a lot of churn on the page when charts are fully re-rendered for every change.

I changed this so that instead of recreating the Highcharts object, the `<Chart />` now internally diffs the input props and *modifies them in the existing Highcharts object* using the standard Highcharts APIs.

This is a bit more code for us to maintain, but it's a lot faster. In my measurements a single update is down from 400-500ms to 70-90ms. The updates in our randomized dataset are also likely to be more frequent and severe than in real-world data.

After these optimizations, the react-highcharts wrapper library ended up providing so little value that I decided to remove it and just use Highcharts directly instead from the `<Chart/>` component lifecycle methods. This makes the chart render/update logic clearer.

## Native App Support

* Documented use of the web frontend with native hybrid apps, to `NATIVE.md`.
* Added support for the two query parameters requirded for this, `native`, and `jwt`.

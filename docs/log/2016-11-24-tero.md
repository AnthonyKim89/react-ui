## Well Time Slider

Adapted the well page time slider from `corva-web#develop`. It is now partially functional and does already control the T&D Broomstick widget's time on the well page. But further work is needed - see questions below.

Note: The mockup also contains a "depth vs. time" chart as part of the timeline, but I don' think that was included in the existing  implementation. I'm adding another TODO item for it further along the way.

Refactored the slider code to conform to the new app's architecture and modified its CSS to conform to the new app's CSS architecture (described in `CSS.md`).

Installed the [rc-slider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rc-slider) component which was and still is used by the time slider.

Also added the supporting serverside code, lifted directly from the `develop` branch of `corva-web` to `master`:

* `app/charts/timeline_slider.rb`
* `app/controllers/api/v1/drill_view/timeline_sliders_controller.rb`
* `app/views/api/v1/drill_view/timeline_sliders/show.json.jbuilder`
* The route definition in `config/routes.rb`.

### Questions

* How should we set the default position of the slider?
   Default should be realtime (last time). But, we should add date query string param when you update it so that URL can be shared.
* The activity markers on the slider are positioned based on the relative values of `item.start_time`/`item.end_time` to `jobData.start_date`/`jobData.end_date`. But for the wells I've been able to test with, `jobData.end_date` has been `null`, causing the markers never to be vibible. *Should* there always be a value for `jobData.end_date` or should the positioning use some other logic?
   What is item.start_time/end_time? What does that mean? Job.last_date is a programmatic way to query the last record in the DB. Should we cache this data on the job model like job.start_date?
* How should we determine the times given to widgets on *Dashboards*, where there is no timeline?
   If it is a widget that needs a datetime, it should be realtime. Never can I imagine a widget on the "dashboards" that uses an old datetime that is not realtime. Some widgets will not have a datetime param as it will be a timerange, for example, last 3/6/12 months, etc. 
* The status bar contains *hardcoded values* for the following. Please instruct where to obtain the actual values:
   This data is from the last record in wits_record. Job.last_wits_record - This data is going to be live, so this will need to be wired using the sockets.
   * Bit: 18,001ft - wits_record.bit_depth
   * Hole: 18,001ft - wits_record.hole_depth
   * "Circulating" label with a purple marker. - wits_record.state
   * Light green status marker - job.status
* The Rails code is raising exceptions like `ActiveModel::MissingAttributeError - missing attribute: drilled_at` for the timeline API. It seems to originate when trying to work with values returned from `Job#get_depth_summary`. What should be done about this?
   This might be old data. Some old tables don't have drilled_at, although it should.

## Unit Testing

Added some initial unit tests for the project. We use [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) as the test framework, as it is built into the `create-react-app` scripts. See the project root `README.md` for general guidelines on unit testing.

Also installed [enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) mostly to support shallow rendering of components in unit tests. This is most often useful for components that render third party JS code, such as `<Charts />`. We don't want it to try to load Highcharts in unit tests because it won't work in the limited DOM environment available in Jest.

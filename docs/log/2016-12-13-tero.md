# Dev Notes 2016-12-13

## Concept Rename

* Globally renamed Widgets to Apps in code and docs

## App Addition

* Applied new UI design for addition screen, with full page size and pentagonal app icons.
* Added the filter UI to the add dialog: Support filtering by category and name.

## App Removal

* Added app removal functionality through a new App Settings dialog. (The removal is so far the only thing in that dialog). Makes a DELETE request to the API endpoint and then removes the app from the grid.

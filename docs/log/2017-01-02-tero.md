# Dev Notes 2017-01-02

## App Settings

* Fleshed out the app-specific setting editor infrastructure: An app type may now provide its own specific setting editor that will be embedded in the app settings dialog.
  * Implemented the T&D graph colors setting.
  * Documented in `APPS.md` how application-specific settings can be created for future apps.
* Added the [react-color](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/) library to the project to support the color pickers for T&D graph colors. Chose the "Compact" color picker for now, but any of the other picker types supported by the library can be easily used as well.

## Loading Indicators

* Added loading indicators to main app loading state, and for the T&D broomstick. Both use the same `<LoadingIndicator />` component based on http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/

# Dev Notes 2016-11-01

## Grid

Added the [react-grid-layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-grid-layout) package to the project and integrated it to the widget grid.

This is a popular library inspired partly by the Gridster lib that was used in prototypes before, but neatly integrated to React and without a dependency on jQuery.

The following responsive breakpoints have been configured to `WidgetGrid`,
though they may be very easily changed later:

* Large: 8 columns, min width 1024px.
* Medium: 4 columns, min width 512px;
* Small: 1 column

The widgets themselves are given their current size as an input prop, so that each widget may render itself adaptively based on its current size. Rather than using numeric pixel sizes here, widgets are given one of the size constants in `src/widgets/constants.js` (small, medium, large, xlarge).

## Charts

Added the [amcharts3-react](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts3-react) package for charting.

Started building the Torque and Drag Broomstick chart with this package. Decided to encapsulate the amcharts details into our components (current `src/common/Chart.js`) so that we can switch chart implementations if we run into limitations in performance or the features of amchart.

On top of the worries about performance, I'm concerned about the quality of the `amcharts3-react` package, since it is very new and does not seem mature. Its source code is littered with TODOs like "is this correct?", for example. I also already ran into some problems trying to dynamically change axis label visibility based on widget sizing.

## Server API Design

Started documenting the way we should construct APIs into `docs/API.md`. Drafted an API for the Torque and Drag Broomstick chart here. Some of the structures and terminology are probably non-optimal, as the domain is still not fully familiar to me. We can change these as needed.

There is a placeholder implementation of the API in the `tandd-api-poc` branch of `corva-web`. (Only contains hardcoded placeholder data right now.) This is called by the frontend widget.

## Proposed Next Steps

* I would like to evaluate using [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) for charting as a replacement for am-charts. I have had good experiences with it in recent projects. It is not free though, and has a similar [commercial license](https://shop.highsoft.com/highcharts) as amCharts does.
* On the server side, should evaluate my API design proposal, make necessary adjustments, and then write the serverside implementation to plug in actual Torque and Drag data.

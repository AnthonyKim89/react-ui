# Dev Notes 2016-11-01

## Grid

Added the [react-grid-layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-grid-layout) package to the project and integrated it to the widget grid.

This is a popular library inspired partly by the Gridster lib that was used in prototypes before, but neatly integrated to React and without a dependency on jQuery.

The following responsive breakpoints have been configured to `WidgetGrid`,
though they may be very easily changed later:

* Large: 8 columns, min width 1024px.
* Medium: 4 columns, min width 512px;
* Small: 1 column

The widgets themselves are given their current size as an input prop, so that each widget may render itself adaptively based on its current size. Rather than using numeric pixel sizes here, widgets are given one of the size constants in `src/widgets/constants.js` (small, medium, large, xlarge).

## Charts

Added the [amcharts3-react](https://github.com/amcharts/amcharts3-react) package for charting.

Started building the Torque and Drag Broomstick chart with this package. Decided to encapsulate the amcharts details into our components (current `src/common/Chart.js`) so that we can switch chart implementations if we run into limitations in performance or the features of amchart.

## Server API Design

Started documenting the way we should construct APIs into `docs/API.md`. Drafted an API for the Torque and Drag Broomstick chart here. Some of the structures and terminology are probably non-optimal here, as the domain is still not fully familiar to me. We can change these as needed.

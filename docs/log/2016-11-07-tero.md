# Dev Notes 2016-11-01

Added the [react-grid-layout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-grid-layout) package to the project and integrated it to the widget grid.

This is a popular library inspired partly by Gridster that was used in prototypes before, but neatly integrated to React and without a dependency on jQuery.

The following responsive breakpoints have been configured to `WidgetGrid`,
though they may be very easily changed later:

* Large: 8 columns, min width 1024px.
* Medium: 4 columns, min width 512px;
* Small: 1 column

## App Settings & Asset Resolution

* Generalized App Settings on Dashboards so that potentially any kind of assets can be selected. Each app has a constant config value that defines which asset types it supports. (I guess it will be "rig" for pretty much everything at this point.) Assets of these defined types are then loaded into the settings dialog.
* Implemented an "active asset" resolution logic where certain assets (currently rigs) are checked for their active child when they're loaded. The active child is then what will be used in the app instance, including the real-time subscription. 
  * All loaded assets are stored in a single flat identity map managed by the pages reducer. The loading is done by dispatching an action to the pages reducer. This is done e.g. when a dashboard is loaded for all apps on it, when an asset page is loaded, or when the asset is changed in app settings.
  * Whenever an asset is loaded, its active child is loaded as well (and further active descendants recursively if necessary) and all the loaded assets are put into the identity map.
  * The assets that actually given to the app instances are always the active children when applicable. So, for example, the `asset` prop of an app is never going to be a rig, but always a well. This resolution from the asset identity map is done in the `dashboardAppAssets` selector of the pages reducer.

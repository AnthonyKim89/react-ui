## App Settings & Asset Resolution

* Generalized App Settings on Dashboards so that potentially any kind of assets can be selected. Each app has a constant config value that defines which asset types it supports. (I guess it will be "rig" for pretty much everything at this point.) Assets of these defined types are then loaded into the settings dialog.

## Well Page Generalization & Control Apps
 
* Renamed Well Pages to Asset Pages and Asset Page Tabs in code and documentation.
* Removed `WellTimeline` from the Asset Page and replaced it with a general concept of *Control Apps*:
  * Asset pages are now completely generic and free of asset-type specific components.
  * Instead, the app registry contains control apps bound to asset types that the asset page will display. The Well Timeline is now such a control app.
  * Control apps may set parameters that are serialized into the page URL query string, and reflected back to all UI and control apps on the page. The Well Timeline sets a `drillTime` parameters that all apps receive (and the Asset Page doesn't have to know anything about this, remaining generic).
* Updated documentation in `APPS.md` to cover the concept of control apps.

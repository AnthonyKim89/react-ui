# Dev Notes 2016-12-14

## App Addition

* Also made app addition work on Well Pages, not just dashboards.

## App Settings

* Added support for changing app settings in the settings dialog.
* Some settings are provided by the surrounding page and are added to every app's settings dialog. On the Dashboard this is used for the Active Rig setting that all apps should have. It is *not* used on well pages. 
   * This setting editor is implemented in `DashboardAppRigSettingEditor` that displays a dropdown of the Rigs of the current user's company (fetched from the API).

## Rig Resolving

On the Dashboard, apps are tied to rigs, not wells. So that means sometimes we have a `rigId` and sometimes a `wellId` to get data from. 

Currently, the torque and drag app will check which one we have. If it's a rig, it will first ask the API for that rig's current well (job) before fetching data. 

This behavior is probably going to be needed for most apps, so we should find a way to abstract it out of the `torqueAndDrag` app to the common code. Optimally apps would always get a wellId and could just straightforwardly get its data.

## General UI

* Made the main navigation bar use more of the default Bootstrap navigation components. Among other things, this made it function better on small screens (getting a collapsible "Hamburger" menu)
* Also made the app settings dialog responsive so it fits better to small screens (uses more screen real estate and switches to single column)

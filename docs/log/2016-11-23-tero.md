# Dev Notes 2016-11-23

## Dashboard / Widget Set API

* Implemented the features that dynamically load Dashboard and Well Page contents based on serverside API.
* When the user resizes or moves a widget, those settings are also written to the API using a `PUT` request.
* These features are stubbed on the serverside, but fully functional on the client side.
  * The calls are also documented in `API.md`.

## Things to consider:

* The Immutable.js API is starting to feel unwieldy in this project's context. 
  At some point soon should spike a version without it to see if it feels better.
* We need to start thinking about where in the architecture we want to deal with
  the default contents of dashboards and well pages. Server or client?

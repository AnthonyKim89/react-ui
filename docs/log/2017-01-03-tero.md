## Adding Apps

* Added the second "app details" page of the add app dialog, as per UI design.
* To this page, added the Asset Selector setting so that when Apps are added to Dashboards, the user must choose the asset to use. This is not done on Asset Pages where the asset comes from the page.
  * This is implemneted so that setting editors have a "required" attribute, which is currently `true` only for the asset selector. Any required settings will be shown in the Add App dialog, and must be given values before the app can be added.

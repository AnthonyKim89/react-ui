# Dev Notes 2017-01-02

## Adding Apps

* Added the second "app details" page of the add app dialog, as per UI design.
* To this page, added the Asset Selector setting so that when Apps are added to Dashboards, the user must choose the asset to use. This is not done on Asset Pages where the asset comes from the page.
  * This is implemneted so that setting editors have a "required" attribute, which is currently `true` only for the asset selector. Any required settings will be shown in the Add App dialog, and must be given values before the app can be added.

## More App Types

* Added basic implementations of the "Axial Load" and "Stress" apps in order to get some more content to work with. They are both simple charts.
  * Extracted the chart color editor and some smaller things out of TnD to make things more reusable.
  * Even though "Axial Load" and "Stress" apps don't contain much code (they just wrap a chart and the chart colors editor), there's still duplication there because they are so extremely similar. If this continues to be the case, we should find some further code abstraction they both could use.

# Dev Notes 2016-11-28

## Widgets

* Added support for widget subtitles. Used in T&D Broomstick.

## Well Time Slider

* Use `last_date` as a basis for calculating activity positions. This is a new attribute now exposed by the API based on the serverside `Job#last_date`.
* Show well name, rig name, and status in the status bar (also based on newly added attributes in the server-returned JSON).
* Show bit depth, hole depth, and status based on the last record in wits_record (based on newly added attributes in the server-returned JSON).

# Dev Notes 2016-11-28

## Widgets & Pages

* Added support for widget subtitles. Used in T&D Broomstick.
* Display the current tab title in the well tab bar.

## Well Time Slider

* Use `last_date` as a basis for calculating activity positions. This is a new attribute now exposed by the API based on the serverside `Job#last_date`.
* Show well name, rig name, and status in the status bar (also based on newly added attributes in the server-returned JSON).
* Show bit depth, hole depth, and status based on the last record in wits_record (based on newly added attributes in the server-returned JSON).
* Initialize the value of the time slider based on the last tooltip depth.
* Cycle the drill time through query param so that it persists through reloads, tab changes, and users can share links to specific points in time.
* Implement the functionality for the left/right step arrow buttons.
* Integrate the [font-awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) library which was being used for the "slide up/down" arrow of the well status bar.

# Dev Notes 2016-11-09

## Torque and Drag Broomstick API changes

* Moved to API organization scheme by "feature area", where the broomstick API is now under `/api/jobs/{jobId}/torque_and_drag/broomstick_chart`.
* Merged the API placeholder code in `corva-web` to the master branch.

## Charts

* Replaced the amCharts implementation in `Chart.js` with a Highcharts based one.
* Implemented the first "responsive" features for the chart, where its legend and axis labels are hidden when displayed in small size.

## CSS & Design

* Switched to a more systematic CSS architecture, with instructions outlined in `docs/CSS.md`.
* Switched the dashboard tab bar to use fixed positioning so that it does not scroll away.

# Dev Notes 2016-11-09

## Architecture

* Attempted codifying the central concepts and their relationships in the `WIDGETS.md` guide.

## Torque and Drag Broomstick API changes

* Moved to API organization scheme by "feature area", where the broomstick API is now under `/api/jobs/{jobId}/torque_and_drag/broomstick_chart`.
* Merged the API placeholder code in `corva-web` to the master branch.

## Charts

* Replaced the amCharts implementation in `Chart.js` with a Highcharts based one.
* Implemented the first "responsive" features for the chart, where its legend and axis labels are hidden when displayed in small size.

## CSS & Design

* Switched to a more systematic CSS architecture, with instructions outlined in `docs/CSS.md`.
* Switched the dashboard tab bar to use fixed positioning so that it does not scroll away.

## Input Needed

* Are the concepts and their descriptions in `WIDGETS.md` correct? If not, please update or let me know.
* Several questions came to mind when doing this:
  * What exactly is the relationship between rigs and wells? I understand that "a rig may have many wells", but which do we actually show in the UI? Is a widget tied to a rig or a well?
  * Are all widgets of all types always tied to one rig/well? (Either explicitly by the user or by virtue of being placed on a well page)
  * I presume we're going to have some default dashboards and well pages that users see when they first use the system, and can then customize for themselves?
  * How should the Dashboard sharing work? Can any user share a dashboard? What's the scope of the sharing - do they share it to specific other users, or perhaps for all other users in their own account/company? Can other users edit a shared dashboard, or just the original owner?

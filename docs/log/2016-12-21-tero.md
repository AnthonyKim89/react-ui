## API Integration / Subscriptions

* Implemented a real-time subscription model, where all apps are subscribed to receive their data from `corva-subscriptions` when they are mounted on the screen.
  * The subscriptions and unsubscriptions are initiated by the `AppContainer` component.
  * Unsubscriptions and unsubscriptions cause `SUBSCRIBE_APP` and `UNSUBSCRIBE_APP` actions to be dispatched on the pages reducer.
  * The actual subscription/unsubscription to the remote `corva-subscriptions` service is done from the action handlers of these actions.
  * Whenever any data is received for any subscription, that is handled by the same Redux action: `RECEIVE_APP_DATA`. The data is put in a Map inside the pages reducer state, which contains the latest state of every app instance. (To prevent memory leaks, the data is cleared when an app instance unsubscribes.)
  * From the common app data map, each app is given its latest data as an input prop.
* The result of this model is that apps don't usually have to do anything to receive their data - they're just given to it as an input prop which is always up to date. They just need to render it.

## Torque & Drag Broomstick

* Removed the app-local Redux reducer/actions/selectors from the app, since after the subscription implementation the app component is now so simple that using Redux is not justified.

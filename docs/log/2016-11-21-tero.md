# Dev Notes 2016-11-21

## TODO List

* Collected from Slack and emails a list of work items that should be done in the project, into `docs/TODO.md`.

## Chart Changes

* Added a `<ChartSeries />` component that chart users can use to define the 
  chart data series in an idiomatic way. This allowed e.g. moving broomstick
  series color configuration from `Chart.js` to `TorqueAndDragBroomstickWidget.js`.

## Dashboard / Widget Set API

* Drafted a dashboard API / data model in `API.md` and added a stub implementation in the `corva-web` project.
* Started work on dynamically loading the UI based on the dashboard data. This is still work in progress.
* As part of this, added the [react-router-redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux) library that allows for router state to be held in the Redux store, and dispatching actions for navigation (useful when we want to navigate from an action handler).

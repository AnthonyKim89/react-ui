# Dev Notes 2016-11-21

## TODO List

* Collected from Slack and emails a list of work items that should be done in the project, into `docs/TODO.md`.

## Chart Changes

* Added a `<ChartSeries />` component that chart users can use to define the 
  chart data series in an idiomatic way. This allowed e.g. moving broomstick
  series color configuration from `Chart.js` to `TorqueAndDragBroomstickWidget.js`.

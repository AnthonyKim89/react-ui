## Authentication

Added a Redux middleware (`authMiddleware.js`) that will intercept any server-accessing action handlers and check for authentication problems in the response. They will be redirected to the login page. This is to handle situations where the user's authentication token expires in the middle of their session. (Previously this was handled only when the application loaded.)

# Dev Notes 2017-01-17 - 2017-01-18

## Subscriptions

* Refactor subscriptions so that each app may make many of them:
  * Every app's constants include a `SUBSCRIPTIONS` constants, which is 
    an array of all the subscriptions the app will make.
  * When an app is mounted, a subscription is establishes for each of the
    app's subscriptions, and initial data is also fetched for each of them.
  * Apps now receive their `data` property as an Immutable Map from subscription
    keys (from the `SUBSCRIPTIONS` constant) to the data for that subsriptions.
    Apps need to look up the data for each subscription themselves.
  * The corresponding changes have also been made to `corva-subscriptions`: It
    supports maintaining several subscriptions per app instance.

## API Changes

* Refactored code due to changes in `corva-api`:
  * Asset ids are now numbers, not strings.
  * Attribute name change: `parent_id` -> `parent_asset_id`.

## App Settings

* Changed the convention of organizing app settings, so that for each app they're in a separate `settings.js` file.
* Render common settings (basically "Active Asset") before app-specific
  settings in the App Settings dialog.

## Traces

* Implemented an initial version of the Single Trace app.

## Libraries

* Installed [numeral.js](http://numeraljs.com/) for number formatting,
  used in the single trace app now and can be used anywhere numbers need 
  to be displayed in a specific format.

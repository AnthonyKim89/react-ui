# Dev Notes 2016-11-01

Added some new dependencies to the basic tech stack of the project, in line with what was already in `corva-web#develop`:

* Redux & react-redux & redux-thunk
* Immutable.js
* Lodash

Also added some additional helper libraries:

* [reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) for efficiently computing derived state from the Redux store.
* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/) for date/time handling.
* [query-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string) for formatting API query params.

## Widget Architecture

Fleshed out an initial widget architecture including a Redux setup for the "Torque And Drag Broomstick" widget, and started documenting a widget authoring guide in [WIDGETS.md](../WIDGETS.md).

For now, widget instances as well as their input props are hardcoded in `WidgetGrid.js`. This enables widget authoring to begin even while the surrounding widget grid implementation is still under construction.

## API Integration

Added basic API integration support to the project (in `src/api.js`). It uses the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) standard for making requests and return [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) of the response JSON bodies.

When run in development mode, API requests are proxied over to `http://localhost:3000` where we expect the Rails application to be hosted. The user must also be logged into the app.

I got torque broomstick data using the `drill_view` API endpoint. This seemed to do the trick for now.

## Proposed Next Steps

* Widget authoring can now be started, since the basic building blocks are there: Making and styling components, calling APIs, organizing state & logic with Redux.
  * The architecture will naturally be quite volatile for the time being. We'll adjust it to address the needs that come up when widgets are added.
* The Widget grid implementation itself can now also be started.
  * Sizing & layout of widgets.
  * Global time control(s).
  * Settings & props.
  * Adding, removing widgets. 
* Examples and guidelines for unit testing.
* Examples and guidelines for organizing CSS, using shared components, and using Bootstrap components.
* Integrating to `corva-web` and its navigation.
* Should decide on direction for charting: Should we continue with amCharts or use something else?
* I think it would fit the new modular frontend widget approach better if the Rails app also had smaller, more focused API endpoints for requesting the data.
  * For example, the TAndD widget could request only the data needed for that. The `drill_view` endpoint does have the data, but it also seems to have several parameters and response entries in it that aren't necessary for that widget. Ideally we'd get only the data required by this widget in a convenient format.
* Need to clarify and decide on terminology used in frontend code. For example, should we talk about "Wells" instead of "Jobs"?

# Dev Notes 2016-11-01

Added some new dependencies to the basic tech stack of the project, in line with what was already in `corva-web#develop`:

* Redux & react-redux
* Immutable.js
* Lodash

Also added some additional helper libraries:

* [Moment.js](http://momentjs.com/docs/) for date/time handling.
* [query-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string) for formatting API query params.

## Widget Architecture

Flushed out an initial widget architecture for the "Torque And Drag Broomstick" widget, and started documenting a widget authoring guide in [../WIDGETS.md].

For now, widget instances as well as their input props are hardcoded in `WidgetGrid.js`. This enables widget authoring to begin even while the surrounding widget grid implementation is still under construction.

## API Integration

Added basic API integration support to the project (in `src/api.js`). It uses the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) standard for making requests and return [Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise) of the response JSON bodies.

When run in development mode, API requests are proxied over to `http://localhost:3000` where we expect the Rails application to be hosted. The user must also be logged into the app.

I got torque broomstick data using the `drill_view` API endpoint. This seems to do the trick for now.

## Proposed Next Steps

* I think it would fit the new modular frontend widget approach better if the Rails app also had smaller, more focused API endpoints for requesting the data.
** For example, the TAndD widget could request only the data needed for that. The `drill_view` endpoint does have the data, but it also seems to have several parameters and response entries in it that aren't necessary for that widget.

## Inputs Needed

* Need to clarify and decided on terminology used in frontend code. For example, should we talk about "Wells" instead of "Jobs"?

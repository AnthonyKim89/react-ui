## Asset Navigation

* Added parent asset displays to asset listings. The code for this is completely generic, and supports any parent hierarchies of any sizes (currently there's well->rig->program and rig->program). The only requirements is that the hierarchy is configured into `ASSET_TYPES` in `src/pages/constants.js`.
* Architectural change: Broke asset managament into its own top level reducer/actions/selectors because the pages code was growing pretty large and the asset managament provides its own cohesive whole:
  * The reducer maintains an identity map of assets.
  * The actions provide actions for loading assets into it.
  * The selectors provide ways of deriving asset information from it.

# Dev Notes 2017-01-10

## Asset Navigation

* Added parent asset displays to asset listings. The code for this is completely generic, and supports any parent hierarchies of any sizes (currently there's well->rig->program and rig->program). The only requirements is that the hierarchy is configured into `ASSET_TYPES` in `src/pages/constants.js`.
* Architectural change: Broke asset managament into its own top level reducer/actions/selectors because the pages code was growing pretty large and the asset managament provides its own cohesive whole:
  * The reducer maintains an identity map of assets.
  * The actions provide actions for loading assets into it.
  * The selectors provide ways of deriving asset information from it.
* Changed link rendering on asset list pages so that wells and rigs are linkable to asset pages but programs not (this is controlled by a flag in the constant `ASSET_TYPES` map)
  * Also changed the resolution of assets on asset pages to support active child resolution. This means that rigs now also have asset pages, but they use the active well as the concrete assets. You can save a bookmark or send a link to a rig page and it will always use the rig's currently active well.
* Added support for visual asset status indication, via a reusable `<AssetStatus />` component.
* Added a list of "recent" assets to the main menu, shown under "All Rigs" and "All Wells". Currently it's not really *recent*, but just the first few rigs found.

## Well Timeline

* Use asset information on the well timeline to show the well and rig name.
* Also use the new `<AssetStatus />` component to display the well status.
* Architectural change: Control apps now receive an `asset` map as a prop, not just the asset id.
